# Canteen
This is my NCEA Level 2 coding project, where I made a website for my High School's Canteen using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

# Description
This project is entirely front-end due to the requirements of the assessment and time constraints. I chose JavaScript for this project instead of C# because I deemed a web-application to be more accessible and easier to navigate for staff and students.
